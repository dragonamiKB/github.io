Andrew Prokop reporting for Vox:

> The recount of the vote tally for a key race in last month’s Virginia House of 
> Delegates elections concluded on Tuesday. And incredibly enough, when the dust 
> settled, the Democratic challenger led the Republican incumbent by just one 
> vote — an outcome that would deprive Republicans of their majority in the 
> chamber.

This one’s for those of you out there who say your vote doesn’t matter.
