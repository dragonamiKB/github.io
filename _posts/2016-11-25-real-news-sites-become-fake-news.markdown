Loren Grush at the Verge:

> Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a

I would expect this from teenagers giving hot takes on Facebook. These, however, are *supposed* to be legitimate publications. Just because someone tweets it does not mean it's true, this is internet 101. This is lazy journalism in an attempt to get the clicks.

Loren again:

> [...] this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, 
> it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from 
> one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate 
> CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

> The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have 
> played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this 
> won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.
