The Mediate's Kipp Jones:

> A Texas Department of Public Safety official said responding officers were cautious as they entered 
> Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas because “they could’ve been shot.” 
> 
> Nineteen children and two teachers [were murdered][1] after authorities say an 18-year-old male entered 
> with a rifle 12 minutes after he crashed a car near campus. The New York Times [reported][2] the shooter 
> was inside the school for about [an hour][3] before officers finally breached the classroom he was in 
> and shot and killed him.
> 
> Reporters demanded answers during a contentious [press conference][4] Thursday afternoon. State law 
> enforcement officials addressed the public a day after some parents with children in the school said 
> they were [prevented][5] from going in by officers.
> 
> One girl inside the room reportedly bled for an hour after she was shot. [She died][6] at a hospital. It 
> is unknown if that hour might have saved her life.
