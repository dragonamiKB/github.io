My wife and I finally bought Season Tickets for the LA Rams.

It’s been a long road to get here.

My wife an I have been hoping the Rams moved back to L.A. since we were in High School. Admittedly, I never saw them, or even knew who they were, the last time they were in L.A., my family wasn’t into sports when I was growing up, unless it was soccer, and that never much interested me. My first exposure to the Horns was fairly recent, [Super Bowl XXXVI][1], I had gone to a Super Bowl Party, and you know, you have to pick a side. The side I chose was based on two factors:

1. The Rams were favored to win thanks to [The Greatest Show on Turf][2].
2. The Girl I liked, and my future wife, was rooting for that team. (*Yes, my wife got me into Football*)

I had no clue what the hell was going on, up until this point, I’d only watched Football in passing and had never watched a High School Football game. But I had fun. I enjoyed watching that game. I couldn’t tell a Tackle from a Pass, and half the time, I didn’t know who was on Offense or Defense, but I still Enjoyed the experience.

Fast forward thirteen years, and my wife and I attended our first live game. It was the San Diego Chargers against our then St. Louis Rams. You want to talk about an experience, Man. I was hoarse after the game, I had started getting a migraine half-way through (*it was hot and I have an issue with drinking water, but hey, lesson learned*), but man, I didn’t care, it was great. The Fans, even though they were—*gulp*—Charger Fans. But to experience that game live, literally *FEELING* the excitement as the cheers echoed and vibrated through the stands. Wow. We’ve always talked about wanting the rams to come back to LA, have them close to us, but more so after we went to that game.

There’d been rumors for years that they’d be coming back, but it was always next season, next season.

Well, next season finally arrived. January this year, when the NFL gave the go ahead for them to move back, they wasted no time in taking deposits for season tickets. That was a painful process, first, my wife and I weren’t expecting it, I don’t know why, but the day and time caught us off guard. Secondly, Ticketmaster buckled under the pressure a few times, but we kept trying, because we were getting our season tickets. When we finally got in and were able to put down our deposit, 37 minutes had passed. An eternity. But the excitement set in, it was happening, it was real, we had taken our fist step to buying those season tickets.

Then started the wait. The Long. Torturous. Wait. No information was ever made available about when the tickets would start going on sale, just “later in the spring”. Alright Apple.

But we waited, me a little more patiently than my wife (*if you haven’t caught on, she’s a bigger Football Fan than me*). Last month, the news that sales would start and would be done in waves was announced. The first wave got their emails telling them to get ready. The Rams started the [@LARamsServices][3] Twitter account to answer questions and help with problems.

Then the bad news. That first wave covered only the first two minutes. We weren’t ever going to get tickets. Panic began to set in; What if there weren’t any seats left? The second wave came, the first 10 minutes. The third wave, the first 15–20 minutes. That was progress, but still we were convinced that the only season seats we were getting were at a Buffalo Wild Wings, and only of we got there early, because those fill up fast too.

It was around this time that my wife and I started getting really worried, and really frustrated. The lack of information about what the inventory of seats looked like and the fact that there were season tickets already on sale at StubHub caused me to go a little twitter rant. Luckily, the [@LARamsServices][3] Twitter account was awesome. They DM’d my wife and I and even offered to call to talk to us to discuss our concerns. They were great.

Then it happened, we got our email, wave four was our wave, June 9 at 3 PM was our window. But still, we couldn’t see what was available, so we had no idea what we’d be getting; Behind a goal post? Outside in the parking lot? But once again, [@LARamsServices][3] to the rescue (*have I mentioned this guy and gal duo are great?*) they offered to have us call them a an hour or so prior to our window opening so they could tell us what was available. When our window finally opened, we knew where we were buying our tickets.

We put down our money and made one of the most satisfying purchases of our lives. I’m excited, like really excited. I’ve been craving that feeling again, the rumbling of the stadium, the cheers. The seats may not be in the section we originally wanted, and they may be a little higher up than we had hoped, but we’ll be there, full rams gear, screaming our lungs out to support our team with the rest our #Ramily. Horns Up.
