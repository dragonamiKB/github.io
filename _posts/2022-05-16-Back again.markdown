I'm back. After a long absence that roughly coincided with the pandemic, I've revived <dragonami.com>. It went offline for a while, but now it's back up and I have a more solid idea of what I'm doing with it. I know that this post probably isn't necessary as it's not like it was a favorite destination on the internet and everyone is interested in finding out what I've been up to the last few years and what's next. I do feel that I'd like to take the opportunity to layout, for myself, what my vision is for this website going forward and what my goals are.

My blogging endeavors have never really been what you would call...consistent. I'd usually go in spurts and blog for a month or two, then give up, the come back a few months later, or take breaks for a year or more at a time, as this last year. Some of it was that when I'd start feeling like I was dropping off, I'd feel bad and that's what would usually lead to the more extended breaks. While I never said it out loud, a part of me hoped that maybe I could turn this into a weird internet job, and I knew that consistency was key, so every time I'd fall off the consistency train, I'd quite altogether rather feeling like a failure. 

I now have a better understanding of what this website means to me, however. I enjoy the opportunity to use it as a learning tool for, not just HTML and CSS, but the ability to learn other languages like PHP and Ruby. I enjoy fussing with the layout and design, even though I'm no designer. And I enjoy having this outlet for thoughts on whatever strikes my fancy. It may not end up being consistent postings, but I think if I allow myself to just post at my own pace, rather than setting a schedule, I'll stick to it and find more enjoyment out of it. After all, this is a hobby, not a job.

If some of you enjoy my writing or musings, that's great. If no one ever reads this but me, that's great too. It is, after all, primarily for me to enjoy the process, and the outcome is secondary. I've added a few items from my old archive, and may continue to add past items as I come across them on my hardrive, or I may not.

So I'm back, and hopefully for good this time.
