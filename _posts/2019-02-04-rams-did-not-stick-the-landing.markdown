title: The Los Angeles Rams' Historic 2018 Season Ends in Heartbreak
---

The 2018 NFL season has come to a close. Like many of you, I didn’t expect it to end this way. The heartbreak was supposed to go to the other team. I believed the Los Angeles Rams would finally get sweet, sweet vengeance against New England Patriots QB Tom Brady and Head Coach Bill Belichick.

But here we are.

The confetti has fallen. The Lombardi Trophy has been presented. It’s heading back to Foxborough. Again.

Yuck.

I am angry, frustrated, and sad. And I’m sympathetic to the players who actually played in the game because I’m sure they’re feeling the same way. The defense had the game of their life, holding Brady and the Patriots to only 3 points going into the 4th quarter. The offense knows that it was anemic and needed to do better. And for some of the players eyeing retirement, this may have been their last shot.

But, while it’s easy to get caught in the vacuum of this loss, I understand, as we all should, that this season was amazing. Two or more seasons ago, getting to the Super Bowl was a pipe dream. Now, we know we’re coming back, we’re too good not to. Maybe it’s next season, maybe it’s two seasons from now, but we’ll be back. The playoffs are no longer going to be strangers to us and this team either, they’re going to be a close friend that we see often.

So, let’s take some time to mourn this loss and then as 3k said, move [forward, onward, and upward.][1]

One last thing while we’re all trolling around social media: Let’s try and remember that the players are human beings too.

On to the offseason.
