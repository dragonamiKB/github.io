title: Congress' Encryption Working Group Agrees "Back Door" Laws are Harmful
---

The House Judiciary Committee & House Energy and Commerce Committee Encryption Working Group released their [year-end report][1] on the ongoing encryption debate between tech companies and law enforcement. While the debate has been going on since encryption became a thing, it was intensified last year after the [FBI tried to force Apple][2] to create a backdoor to it’s iOS software on the phone of the San Bernardino shooter’s phone.

The whole document is worth a read, but there are a few things in particular that stood out to me:

> Representatives of various private companies told the EWG that a mandate

This has been the crux of the technology sector’s argument. Even if congress were to weaken encryption at home, or force US based companies to install backdoors for law enforcement, those laws would only affect companies in the US. That would affect their bottom lines and create an incentive for them to leave the country. Not only that, but there are plenty of other options for bad guys to encrypt their data.

Overall, the considerations of the committee are very smart, and it’s clearly falls on the side against "back doors" in encryption.
