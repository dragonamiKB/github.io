Title: An Ode to Johhny Hekker
---

I’d like to take a moment to reflect on of the most the under-appreciated players in the NFL: LA Rams Punter Johnny Hekker.

I know what you’re thinking. “Kristian, what do you mean underappreciated? I appreciate the hell out of him!” And I believe you! You, dear reader, are a Rams fan. You and I have experienced a prolonged period where the best unit the Rams would field on Sundays was the Special Teams unit. A lot of that is thanks to the very capable abilities of Special Teams Coach John Fassel, but Hekker’s contributions are tremendous.

When our offense was terrible, he gave our defense a fighting chance by literally flipping the field, kicking punts [as far as 78 yards][1]. I’m going to give you a second to take that in.

And punting isn’t his only skill, he can throw the ball too. He’s got an overall [60% completion rate and a career 112.4 passer rating][2]. To compare, Jared Goff has a [60.2% completion rate and a 90.5 passer rating][3]. I’m not advocating for Hekker to replace Goff here (*or am I?*), that’d be dumb, but there is a reason why, for a long time, Hekker has been considered the emergency QB with out reservations from anyone.

And this last week, when K Greg Zuerlein had a pre-game injury against the Cardinals, it was Hekker who stepped in to make the kicks. His kick offs were great, and he made a 20 yard field goal and a point after attempt. Those aren’t Zuerlein numbers to be sure, but in a league where people paid to do nothing but kick field goals and PATs [are missing left and right][4], that’s nothing to scoff at. When asked about it after the game Hekker said it was “A little nerve-wracking, but I’ve watched the best kicker in the NFL, week in and week out, watching Greg Zuerlein practice. I just tried to emulate him as best I could.”

What a professional.

I was hoping he’d win Special Teams player of the Week, but that went to Tennessee Titans S Dane Cruikshank for an [admittedly impressive 66-yard reception and touchdown from a fake punt situation][5]. I’m ok with that.

All those words to say that in a league where it seems like all the headlines and attention go to the flashiest players and [only turns to the special teams when they do badly][6], I wanted to heap some praise on our own #6 for being awesome.

Stay awesome, J Hekk.
