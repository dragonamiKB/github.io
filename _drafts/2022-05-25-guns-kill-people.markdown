I've written and re-written this post dozens of times, yet nothing I can come up with feels adequate. How does one begin speaking to something so reprehensible as the intentional murder of children? 

I could spend thousands of words describing the hypocrisy of those who would allow unfetered access to the weapons of mass murder which allow for such atrocities to become a reality. That, however, would be a wasted effort on my part and a waste of time for you as the reader. 

They do not care, and you likely already know. 

Likewise, spending thousands of words attempting to appeal to the humanity of those who have thus far refused to act, or to shame them into action would be equally fruitless. If the cries of grief stricken parents, spouses, siblings, and friends, or the deaths of hundreds of innocent children have not moved or shamed them into action, nothing I or anyone else could say will do it. 

Those in power have refused to act on, or actively act counter to, reducing access to these weapons have already decided the lives of our family and friends are a worthwhile sacrifice to maintain their grip on power. Those who place and keep such people in power with their votes have fallen for the fantasies fed to them by the NRA and those they support, or have similarly decided their other pet issues, which are almost certainly as asinine and based on similar distortions of reality, are more important than the lives lost to these weapons of war.

I know these things because we've seen them play out before. Then, as now, we see celebrities, elected democrats, and grief stricken parents make impassioned pleas for change. But then, as now, the people whose action they wish to spur are not listening. 

In our youth, we're sold an America that represents liberty, equality, and justice for all. One, who like Captain America, has integrity, who will stand up for those who can't defend themselves and will do what is right because it's right not because and not because it's convenient or easy. 

In truth, that America has never truly existed outside of political rhetoric and perhaps the imaginations and intentions of some of it's founders. The belief that it was slowly but surely making it's way towards fullfiling those promises has always given me hope. I believed in the foundation of the country and believed the framework was sturdy.

I was wrong.

I've realized, as many of us probably have, just how fragile our country really was.

The Second Amendment has long been the armor which the likes of the National Rifle Association (NRA), It's Repbulican (GOP) lackeys, wannabe cops and soldiers, and self-proclaimed "Patriots" who want to play at war, use to protect themselves during horrifyingly common school shootings that claim the lives of children. "Thoughts and Prayers" has been the shield they hide behind as hundreds of lives have needlessly been lost to firearms in school shootings, church massacres, music festival rampages, movie theater murders, and grocery store executions. "Good Guys with Guns" has been the spear they've used to attack any attempt to reign in the carnage and curb the accessability to these instruments of death.
