The Second Amendment has long been the armor which the likes of the National Rifle Association, It's lackeys, wannabe cops, and self-proclaimed "Patriots" who want to play at war, use to protect themselves during the horrifyingly common events that have claimed the lives of over 100 children since Colombine. "Thoughts and Prayers" has been the shield they hide behind as hundreds of lives have needlessly been lost to firearms in school shootings, church massacres, music festival rampages, movie theater murders, and grocery store executions. "Good Guys with Guns" has been they spear they've used to attack any attempt to reign in the carnage and curb the accessability to these instruments of death.

I could spend, as others have before me, thousands of words describing the hypocrisy of those who would allow unfetered access to the weapons of mass murder which allow for such atrocities to become a reality, but that would be a wasted effort on my part and a waste of time for you as the reader. Likewise, spending thousands of words attempting to appeal to the humanity of those who have thus far refused to act, or to shame them into action would be equally fruitless.

"The Lone Wolf" has often been used to abate the conversation around gun reform any time a murderer terrorizes a community with a weapon of war, as if the fact that there isn't a coordinated group of individuals who plan and carry out these terrorist attacks minimizes the trauma and grief they inflict, or that it means they are uncommon and an outlier. To my knowledge, the vast majority of people involved in automobile accidents don't belong to an organized group to purchase and use amphetamines, yet still, some 180 million "Lone Wolves" still obtain and abuse the drug. In contrast to gun-restrictions, however, putting rules in place—which inconvenience those "law-abiding" citizens who have legitamate medical reasons as decided by a physician—to limit the access to something that ruins lives and kills thousands of people a year seems perfectly logical to those who would have unfetered access to the tools of mass murder.

Mental Illness is another common scapegoat often used to redirect the conversation. Yes, mental illness is
